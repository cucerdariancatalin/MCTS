# Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Algorithm in Kotlin

This repository contains an implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm in Kotlin. 

## What is Monte Carlo Tree Search?

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm that is used for finding the best move in games or other decision-making problems. The algorithm uses a tree structure to keep track of different possible moves, and then uses random simulations to evaluate the outcomes of these moves. The final decision is made based on the results of these simulations.

## How to use this code

To use this code, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Then, you can import the MCTS class into your project and call its functions as needed. The MCTS class includes functions for tree expansion, simulation, and selection of the best move.
